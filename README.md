# GamersHaven
Prototype eCommerce store built with a JavasScript, Node and Express.

GamersHaven is a (make believe) eCommerce store built to allow me to develop my fullstack developer skills. Users can list and "purchase" products easilly. Reviews are implemented to increase the complexity of the project. 

## Short Overview and Timeline
First, the backend was fleshed out starting with implementing the product listings, then reviews, the users, and finally cart and checkout functionality. During this phase to focus on making the app work rather than on making it presentable, only html / ejs was used without CSS or structure of the HTML (ex: elements were mostly placed beside each other without divs to separate them or arrange them). Server side errors, authentication, authorization, and relationships between models were given special consideration during this phase. 

In short, on August 3rd, 2022 (day of intial commit), the app was functional, although not visually pleasing.
